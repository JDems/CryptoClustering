# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Prepare the Data, Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame, Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data, Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis, Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data, Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data. These were all the steps used in this exercise.

There was some simple copy and paste from the weeks activities we did in class. Google/chatgpt was also used for perfecting graphs and some syntax. There were some graphs that were very simple just slighty different so you were able to copy an paste some basic stuff.
